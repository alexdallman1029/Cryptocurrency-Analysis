# Cryptocurrency Analysis
## Overview
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. This analysis includes a report about cryptocurrencies on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data is in a .csv file and will be cleaned before fitting it in the machine learning models. Because there is no known output, unsupervised learning will be used. To group the cryptocurrencies, a clustering algorithm will be used. Visualizing the data with hvplot will help display results of the analysis.

## Methods
After data processing is complete, an elbow curve will be made, a method determining the best number of clusters needed for the algorithm to group the objects by. Then, a principal component analysis will be performed, which is a statistical technique to speed up machine learning algorithms when there are too many features. After, clustering algorithms (KMeans) will be used to group similar data points into clusters. Finally, visualization using hvPlot and plotly, will help display the data in 2D and 3D graphs.
